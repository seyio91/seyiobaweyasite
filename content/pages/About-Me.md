<h2>More information about me</h2>
</p>
I currently work as a System Analyst (I think, the job description says Application Engineer), however; my current job involves understanding clientsâ€™ challenges and converting that into requirements for developers, the fun part is sometimes getting to create prototypes in which I develop a minimum viable product, before handing over to the developers.  
update: I have switched to a DevOps role.  
Over the years, I have always wanted to start a blog to share my learning journey and experiences as I cannot stop rambling about tech, but could not get around to it due to a lot of silly excuses and imposter syndrome. Anyways, the new year (2020) brought about a new decade and new resolutions, so I decided to jump on the resolution train and start the blog before excuses come up again. Find my post [here]({filename}/articles/01-creating-static-site.md) on how this blog was kick started 

Although I come from a computing educational background, (fancy way of saying an undergraduate computer engineering degree and a postgraduate degree in information technology), my interest in technology peaked in 2012 as a coping mechanism for a "supposed" heartbreak (Story for another day), while being out of school, staying with parents and without a job. This led to dabbling with numerous tools, technologies and programming languages, trying to figure out what tech area suited me the most. I eventually fell in love with Operations/Infrastructure after discovering Linux and finding the amount of control being given to the user.


I now work full-time with server management and software delivery, but still enjoy tinkering with different technologies during my spare time. Also, with the advent of infrastructure as code, there seems to be a lot of catching up to do with the global tech community, so I spend most of my evenings building tools for work or working on personal projects if I am not at the gym. Another thing I enjoy doing is helping people out with technical problems, as it is a learning opportunity. 

I am however interested in new challenges so feel free to reach out to me at:
