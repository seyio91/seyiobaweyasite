Following is a review of my favorite mechanical keyboard.  
[Gunship](https://www.gunshipmusic.com/) is a *retro synthwave* artist out of the UK.

[Revel in Your Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYRZV8dV10w), 
[Tech Noir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nC5TBv3sfU), 
[Fly for Your Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv1ZN8c4_Gs) 
and 
[The Mountain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HYRTJr8EyA) 
are all quality songs by Gunship. Check out those amazing music videos!
